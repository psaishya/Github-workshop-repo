<p>The algorithm of the program is:</p>
<ul>
<li>	Start. </li>
<li>	Display the introduction of the project, by calling the introduction function. </li>
<li>	Ask if user wants to continue. </li>
<li>	Open a CSV file. </li>
<li>	Check if the CSV file is opened or not by checking if the provided path of the CSV file is correct. </li>
<li>	Read each character from the file and display the contents of file. </li>
<li>	Count the number of rows of data from file and store in <b>n_data</b>. </li>
<li>	Declare an array of structure(previously declared) <b>value_arr</b> of <b>size n_data</b>. </li>
<li>	Skip the line 1 of the file. </li>
<li>	Get each character from file until the end of file indication. </li>
<li>	Store the expected data in <font color="blue">expected member of ith element of array</font> and actual data in <font color="blue">actual member of ith element of array</font>. </li>
<li>	Call the count function. </li>
<li>	Compare the values stored in each member of array with <b>‘Y’</b> and <b>‘N’</b>, and increase the values of <b>TP, FP, FN,</b> accordingly. </li>
<li>	Display the values of TP, FP, and FN. </li>
<li>	Display the menu and ask user to make choice, on what they want to calculate. </li>
<li>	Call the <b>fprecision</b> function if they want to calculate precision. </li>
<li>	Call the <b>frecall</b> function if they want to calculate recall. </li>
<li>	Call both the function if they want to calculate both. </li>
<li>	Call <b>display</b> function if they want to display the contents of file again. </li>
<li>	Quit the program with the thanking message if they want to quit. </li>
<li>	Keep displaying the menu and perform calculations until the user chooses to quit the program. </li>
<li>	Stop. </li>
